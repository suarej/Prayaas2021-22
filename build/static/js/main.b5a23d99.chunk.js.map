After reading the question in the\n        first instance it sounds very easy one. But once you start writing the\n        answer many of you might have faced the mental blockade. Welcome to UPSC\n        guys!!! <br /> Unfortunately not a single answer met all the\n        requirements of the question. Above posted answers are somewhat closer\n        to comprehensive answer. <br />\n        While attempting core society based questions, content is never a\n        problem for the candidate. Almost everyone had enough content to write\n        an answer which can fetch good marks. The key lies in the structuring\n        part. <br /> Use of proper headings and subheadings play deciding factor\n        in such question. So I’ll suggest you to take some time to frame a\n        structure for your answers before writing them down. You can use the\n        following structure for this question:- <br />\n        Here is some more afterthought : <br />\n        You can simply mention that, in older times joint families were\n        preferred as economics of family used to revolve around the agriculture\n        and agriculture needs labours and has less mobility and hence there were\n        emphasis on having joint family. But with changing time dependence of\n        agriculture is rapidly declining. Job mobility through transfers has\n        increase and this changed economic scenario has led to the end of life\n        cycle of joint family.\n        <br /> While giving conclusion, you can say that:- Though economics has\n        compelled us to shift towards nuclear families we still cherish the\n        ethos of joint family due to our social values. For example, we still\n        have occasional get togethers during festivals, marriages and other\n        family events. We are always in touch with our family members through\n        technology. In short roots of joint family system are still there, they\n        have changed from conventional to virtual ones.\n      </GeneralTextContainer>\n      <ListContainer>\n        <ListItem>\n          Economic factors determining the life cycle of Joint family (dont just\n          list them down, DISCUSS them) 50-60 words\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          Social factors determining the life cycle of joint family (restrict it\n          to 20-30 words\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          State the reason why economic factors outweigh social factors ( This\n          is the most important link in this question and is missing in all\n          answer) 15-25 words\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>Conclude accordingly 20-30 words</ListItem>\n      </ListContainer>\n    </SectionContainer>\n  );\n}\n\nexport function FeedbackDayFour() {\n  return (\n    <SectionContainer>\n      <Title>General Feedback</Title>\n      <ListContainer>\n        <ListItem>\n          Still many of you are starting your answer with the definition of\n          poverty or population.

So\n        you can mention in your conclusion that India can develop as we have\n        seen other countries do. But these countries are comparatively smaller\n        and are socio-economically homogenous. Hence development without\n        industrial base can survive there.

Cut short the elaboration of other parts but\n          cover all the angles asked in the question.

First of all let us clear the thing that there\n        is difference between green energy and green energy corridor. You can\n        mention about green energy in the beginning but the question was asking\n        you to focus on green energy corridor and not just green energy.\n        Although question looked straightforward one, we have to cover multiple\n        dimensions in it because it has asked to write a NOTE. Whenever UPSC\n        asks you to WRITE A NOTE on a particular topic we need to cover multiple\n        aspects of the issue. It is similar to that of making note for our\n        studying purpose. For example, while studying green energy we prepare\n        notes on, what green energy is, how it is produced, where it is\n        produced, what are its benefits, what are the challenges/impediments and\n        what are the solutions. So in NOTE type questions rather than looking\n        for what was not required part, we need to look for what was required\n        part.\n      </GeneralTextContainer>\n      <ReqNotReqContainer>What was required?</ReqNotReqContainer>\n      <ListContainer>\n        <ListItem>\n          Start your answer with the larger context around the question, that\n          is, problems of conventional energy and how green energy can provide\n          solution to it.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          While doing so you can provide some data/reports/facts. It will\n          decorate your answer nicely.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          In Main body, first you need to talk about some problems of\n          conventional energy. As this is not the context of the question, you\n          don’t have to elaborate the problems, as we have discussed earlier,\n          whenever we don’t need much elaboration, we can use illustrations to\n          represent it.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          After that go for how Green energy corridor can alleviate the problems\n          of conventional energy part. Here you can simply mention benefits of\n          green energy corridor over conventional energy.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          While doing so one thing should be taken care of. You need to provide\n          arguments in such a way that the problems which you are mentioning\n          above should be addressed through your arguments. For example, if you\n          are mentioning the problem of scarcity of resources in conventional\n          energy part, you can say green energy is abundantly available and\n          hence the scarcity aspect can be taken care of through seamless\n          development of green energy corridors and energy grids.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          At the end of your answer, mention certain issues in harnessing the\n          full benefit of green energy corridor. As it is not the core of your\n          question, you can use illustration to represent it. No need to give\n          elaboration for this part as well.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          In conclusion end your answer on optimistic note with providing steps\n          taken by government towards green energy corridors and suggest\n          optimistic vision for future roadmap.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          In short, your flow should be, problems of conventional energy, how\n          green energy corridor can overcome these problems, issues or hurdles\n          with green energy corridor and solution to those hurdles.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          Now it becomes very difficult to manage all these angles in your\n          answer and that too within 150 words. As we have mentioned earlier,\n          even if you are writing one or two points less it is okay but always\n          try to cover all the angles of the question.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          Complete answer is always better than lopsided and imbalanced one.\n        </ListItem>\n      </ListContainer>\n    </SectionContainer>\n  );\n}\n\nexport function FeedbackDay20() {\n  return (\n    <SectionContainer>\n      <Title>General Feedback</Title>\n      <GeneralTextContainer>\n        Today’s question was a straight forward one and was asking you to\n        discuss the pros and cons of PPP model. The crucial part of today’s\n        question was CRITICALLY DISCUSS. Let’s discuss about today’s question,\n      </GeneralTextContainer>\n      <ReqNotReqContainer>What was not required</ReqNotReqContainer>\n      <ListContainer>\n        <ListItem>No need to mention about PPP model.</ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          No need to discuss about various types of PPP models.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          This question contains leading statement which was, ‘adaptation of PPP\n          model for infrastructure development of the country has not been free\n          from criticism.’ The main question starts after the statement which is\n          critically discuss the pros and cons of the PPP model. Friends,\n          whenever UPSC gives leading statement in the question don’t go on\n          explaining it. You can mention about that leading statement in the\n          start but there was no need to mention it in the main body.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          In short, no need to mention criticism of PPP model separately.\n        </ListItem>\n      </ListContainer>\n      <ReqNotReqContainer>What was required</ReqNotReqContainer>\n      <ListContainer>\n        <ListItem>\n          Start your answer with the greater context around the question and\n          leading statement. Here the context revolves around PPP and leading\n          statement talks about the criticism of the model.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          So in the start, you can mention the need of PPP model in\n          infrastructure and few of its criticisms.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          Addition of any current happenings in the beginning can always add a\n          flavour to your answer. In this answer, you can mention ambitious\n          National Infrastructure Pipeline Project. This project requires huge\n          funding and PPP is the only viable option available in front of\n          government.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          Main body of this question is the easiest one. In question itself UPSC\n          has asked you to discuss the pros and cons of the model.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          Do not give headings like advantages and disadvantages. Although they\n          have similar meanings, but it is always good to use the similar\n          wordings as that of the question. So divide your answer into pros and\n          cons of PPP model.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          There are multiple pros and cons. Don’t keep on listing them.\n          Generally restrict your points to 5/6.

It demands you to discuss\n        the achievements of India in the field of space science and technology.\n        Also, it is asking you to link these achievements to socio economic\n        development of the country. This question was a very general one, and\n        one can write an entire essay on this particular topic. We often face\n        challenges while dealing with such questions, due to lot of content\n        availability. Hence, rather than going for what was not required, we\n        will look directly into what was required part.\n      </GeneralTextContainer>\n      <ReqNotReqContainer>What was required?</ReqNotReqContainer>\n      <ListContainer>\n        <ListItem>\n          Start your answer with the greater context around the question. In\n          this question, you can create the context like, at the time of\n          Independence, India had limited reach in space science as compared to\n          other countries and from that position, we have leapfrogged and became\n          a leading player in the field of space technology through multiple\n          missions like SHAKTI-ASAT, GSLV, Chandrayaan, MOM etc.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          In the main body, first we need to talk about India’s achievements in\n          the field of space science and technology. Here friends, do not\n          separate space, science and technology. It is a combined thing here,\n          and you need to talk about space related stuff only.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          Many of you, while writing the achievements of India, are simply\n          listing down various space missions successfully undertaken by ISRO.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          Various missions is just one aspect of the achievement. India’s\n          achievements are much larger than just launching the space missions.\n          Here you need to pay more attention towards understanding the question\n          rightly.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          Achievement is something which is unique in nature. There are many\n          countries who have launched multiple missions. In that context,\n          launching satellites cannot be attributed to be a great achievement of\n          India. Our achievement lies in low-cost missions, large success rate\n          and near zero failures, less dependency on other countries, high\n          degree of reliability, using PSLV technology to successfully launch\n          inter-planetary missions etc.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          This is the unique demand of this question. If you have just mentioned\n          India’s missions, automatically you might have received the feedback\n          that, your answer lacked depth and you need to do more brainstorming.\n          Unfortunately, 99% of answers received today are lacking this aspect.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          Next part of the main body is comparatively an easier one. Here, you\n          need to link the benefits of space technology to socio economic\n          development of India. While writing this, you need to bring precision\n          and specificity. For example, don’t just mention it will help\n          agriculture. Rather you can write, space initiatives like BHUVAN,\n          NADAMS, FASAL etc. can help in developing agriculture.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          In conclusion part of your answer, mention some of the challenges to\n          the space sector and provide solutions to it.

Question was\n        straight forward one, but over-reliance on M. Laxmikanth only, for GS-2\n        and poor content has made this question too challenging to handle. Due\n        to Lack of content, we hardly came across any answer talking too much\n        about the issue.

This particular question can be linked with the core topic of\n        the syllabus, dispute redressal mechanisms and institutions. Again this\n        topic is the most ignored one. Sometimes we almost forget that there is\n        a chapter named Tribunal in M. Lakshmikanth, because all our energy gets\n        exhausted until we reach to this part of the book. Although it is the\n        most ignored one by aspirants, UPSC has asked two questions on it till\n        the date. As we have very limited knowledge about the topic, almost no\n        one has written much today. Hence rather than going for what was not\n        required part, we’ll directly jump into what was required stuff.

In short you\n          have to compare tribunal and ordinary courts and need to give some\n          insights on whether tribunal’s are competent enough with respect to\n          ordinary courts.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          In the conclusion you can mention certain measures required so that\n          tribunals should not interfere or curtail the jurisdiction of ordinary\n          courts.\n        </ListItem>\n      </ListContainer>\n    </SectionContainer>\n  );\n}\n\nexport function FeedbackDay53() {\n  return (\n    <SectionContainer>\n      <Title>General Feedback</Title>\n      <GeneralTextContainer>\n        Today’s question was based on procedure of disqualification under\n        Representation of Peoples act.

If you take\n        history in the beginning, your initial fresh energy will get consumed by\n        history and you’ll end up in having less enthusiasm and energy while\n        going into comparatively difficult parts, like economy and geography.\n        Apart from this, if you are not revising history regularly, you tend to\n        forget the things.

The term\n          \"them\" in the main question was this first statement. Lets understand\n          how to decode it. Young people means the youth. With ethical conduct,\n          means all the good people, in lay-mans term. Are not willing to come\n          forward to join active politics means they are having NEGATIVE\n          ATTITUDE towards Politics in general and Active Politics in\n          Particular.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          Once the above understanding is clear, it becomes easy to suggest the\n          steps to motivate them, which is the main body.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          For the Introduction, you can mention any fact/figure/data/report\n          stating the ratio of youth in active politics in India or in World.\n          And most importantly with NO CRIMINAL RECORD.

You can suggest steps to decriminalise the\n          politics. You can also suggest the steps which can incentivise the\n          youth. Steps like reservation to youth in Political party are also\n          okay. See, the question is just to suggest the steps, and not to\n          critically analyse them, so the onus of policy implementation is not\n          on you.

Trust me, if you\n        don't dare to attempt NOW, more likely you will fare very bad in actual\n        exam. Today’s question was a tricky one. Firstly, it was only a 10\n        markers and the question has so many demands. But then this is UPSC, so\n        what do you expect otherwise ! Lets see how to deal with such questions\n        in a simple way.\n      </GeneralTextContainer>\n\n      <ReqNotReqContainer>What was required?</ReqNotReqContainer>\n      <ListContainer>\n        <ListItem>\n          It is ok to compromise on the intro for such lengthy questions. So\n          Just one statement about everyone having some attitude towards deep\n          rooted Caste systems is enough.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          Question has 3 demands. First Part was comparatively very easy. Its a\n          What type of Question. So you can simply enlist the list of the\n          factors. But which factors ? Only those factors which create or\n          affects an attitude towards Social Problems. So list can have factors\n          like, Past experiences, Education Background, Gender, Family\n          background, Surrounding Environment, Emotional Intelligence, Value\n          system etc etc.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          Now again, Do NOT waste words to explain how these factors are\n          relevant or try to establish connection or try to add examples for\n          this part. You can not afford to waste any words here, and especially\n          when it is not the demand.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          The next statement is a leading statement. No need to explain it in\n          any way.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          Second Demand of the Question is about your observation of the\n          Contrasting attitudes about CASTE SYSTEM in our society. Here, Focus\n          should be on keywords. Contrasting - means 2 extreme attitudes, hence\n          it is required to mention Positive attitude and Negative attitude\n          about Caste Systems E.g. Few people think Caste System is Must for\n          Indian society and as it serves some purpose, whereas there is a\n          section which believes there should no CASTE systems at all. This is\n          one contrast. Another contract could be, One section believing\n          Equality of all casts, where as another believes in the diversity\n          along with hierarchy. This is another contrast. There can many such\n          contrasts. We leave it to your observation and analysis. But at least\n          2 such pairs should be mentioned along with some explanation or\n          example.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          Moving on to the third demand of the question. This is the tricky one.\n          How do you explain the existence of these contrasting attitude? This\n          part is asking for the RATIONAL behind such extremes. So The first\n          Part where we have mentioned few Factors, take help of them and prove\n          how those factors are not same for all. Hence there is diversity of\n          attitudes and hence the contrasts. Provide any one example to one\n          Factor, e.g. Family background, A child raised on orthodox family\n          which has conservative views about Caste system, is likely to develop\n          similar attitude in contrast to one raised in a Metro city with\n          liberal Parents who belong to different castes or Religion. You can\n          mention at max 2 such factors.\n        </ListItem>\n        <ListItem>\n          Now that's not all, the last part also demands, how these contrasting\n          views are co-existing and what's your stake on this (means your\n          attitude). You can conclude with this part of the answer also, as\n          there will be a crunch of words for this answer.\n        </ListItem>\n      </ListContainer>\n    </SectionContainer>\n  );\n}\n\nexport function FeedbackDay95() {\n  return (\n    <SectionContainer>\n      <Title>General Feedback</Title>\n      <GeneralTextContainer>\n        Today’s question was very simple.
